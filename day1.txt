Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

Interpreter


1.Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.

2.An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.

3.An interpreter does not generate an intermediary code. Hence, an interpreter is highly efficient in terms of its memory.

4.Keeps translating the program continuously till the first error is confronted. 
  If any error is spotted, it stops working and hence debugging becomes easy.

5.Interpreters are used by programming languages like Ruby and Python for example.


Compiler


1.Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

2.A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.

3.A compiler always generates an intermediary object code. It will need further linking. Hence more memory is needed.

4.A compiler generates the error message only after it scans the complete program and
  hence debugging is relatively harder while working with a compiler.

5.Compliers are used by programming languages like C and C++ for example.
